# Music Releases

This is the first project with React. The project was to build a page which shows new albums and singles releases. Created components by using data from Spotify. Darya Lapata and Karoline Mann made this together, pair-programming.

## What I learnt

We learnt a new way to work together and made the team work more efficient. This was our first time working in React, and got a positive first impression. 

What we learnt: 
- how to create components and how to connect them 
- how to pass the data thought the props
- how to write JSX in React 
- how to use .map() function
